This example demonstrates minimal installation of [PSPDFKit Document Engine](https://pspdfkit.com/guides/document-engine/) on 
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) in AWS using Terraform.

The resources deployed will include:
 * [AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html) cluster as Kubernetes platform
   * Addons to integrate Amazon resources for logging and load balancing
 * PostgreSQL database running on [AWS Relational Database Service](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/)
 * [PSPDFKit Document Engine](https://pspdfkit.com/guides/document-engine/)

## Prerequisites

### Tools

* [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
* [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

### Resources

You will need an AWS account, and a [profile set for it](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-configure-files-using-profiles).

You can use the AWS CLI to set this up by running `aws configure --profile document-engine-example`. After running this command, the configuration wizard will guide you through setting up the profile. 

Or you can manually edit the `~/.aws/*` configuration files. 
This entails something like this in `~/.aws/credentials`:


```
[document-engine-example]
aws_access_key_id = ...
aws_secret_access_ke = ...
```

## Setup

Clone this repository.

Prepare Terraform environment by setting the AWS profile and (optionally) region to use. This can be done by setting environment variables:

```shell
export TF_VAR_aws_profile_name="document-engine-example"
export TF_VAR_aws_region="eu-north-1" # Remove or change the default in `terraform.tfvars` file if setting this variable
```

Alternatively, prepare to provide AWS profile name for interactive input during the following commands. 

Put dependencies in place:

```shell
terraform init -upgrade
```

Next, generate a JWT key pair using the `generate-jwt-pair.sh` script

```shell
# Run from within examples/de-aws-eks

../../scripts/generate-jwt-pair.sh
```

Finally, examine the plan and apply it:

```shell
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Output should include deployment information: 

```
...
cluster_name = "pspdfkit-de-demo-fE0JX8Bf"
cluster_vpc_id = "vpc-0d00dfe0eee0641e4"
...
document_engine_url = "http://k8s-pspdfkit-document-1828531825-23172973189273.eu-north-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
kubeconfig_command = "aws eks update-kubeconfig --region eu-north-1 --name pspdfkit-de-demo-fsd797d --kubeconfig .kubeconfig"
```

Note `kubeconfig_command` output, it contains AWS CLI command to retrieve Kubernetes configuration file. It can then be used by setting `KUBECONFIG` environment variable: 

```shell
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region eu-north-1 --name pspdfkit-de-demo-fsd797d --kubeconfig .kubeconfig
export KUBECONFIG="$(pwd)/.kubeconfig"
```

This allows all range of `kubectl` and `helm` commands: 

```shell
kubectl get namespaces
helm status -n pspdfkit-document-engine document-engine
```

We will need the URL from 

## Accessing Document Engine

Terraform deployment output from the previous subsection should contain `document_engine_url` string. 
It corresponds to [AWS Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html) that exposes Document Engine. 

Dashboard is accessible by `/dashboard` path, with default username `admin` and password `admin`.

## Cleanup

To remove the resources created above: 

```shell
terraform destroy
```
